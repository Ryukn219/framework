# Working Groups and Special Interest Groups

Below is a list of FinOps Foundation WG's and SIG's. WG's tend to be cross-functional groups of people producing best practices for a specific capability of challenge in FinOps, and usually operate in 4-8 week sprints. SIG's tend to be ongoing industry, persona or focus groups to provide connection and best practice sharing between those involved. Sometimes SIG's product WG's to create content or WG's product SIG's to create community.
