### Curriculum of the training and certification

For an overview of the the general domains and competencies covered by the training and certification exam, see the [Linux Foundation’s FinOps certification page](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-finops/). It is based on the open source curriculum which resides on [Github](https://github.com/finopsfoundation/curriculum).

### What level of prerequisite knowledge do I need?
You should understand the basics of how cloud computing works, know the key services on your cloud providers, including their common use cases, and have a basic understanding of billing and pricing models. You should already be able to describe the basic value proposition of running in cloud and understand the core concept of using a pay-as-you-go consumption model.

You’ll also need to have a base level of knowledge of at least one of the three main public cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). For AWS, we recommend AWS Business Professional training or, even better, the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification. For Google, check out the Google Cloud Platform Fundamentals course. For Azure, try the Azure Fundamentals learning path. Each can usually be completed in a full day workshop.
